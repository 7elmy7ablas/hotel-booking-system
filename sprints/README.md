# Sprint Planning

This folder contains sprint planning documents and retrospectives for the hotel booking system project.

## Structure
- Each sprint should have its own markdown file (e.g., `sprint-01.md`)
- Include sprint goals, user stories, and outcomes
- Template for sprint documents is provided in `sprint-template.md`

## Sprint Naming Convention
Sprint files should follow the pattern `sprint-XX.md` where XX is the zero-padded sprint number:
- `sprint-01.md` - First sprint
- `sprint-02.md` - Second sprint  
- `sprint-03.md` - Third sprint
- And so on...

## Sprint Document Contents
Each sprint document should include:
- **Sprint Goals**: High-level objectives for the sprint
- **User Stories**: Detailed requirements with acceptance criteria
- **Sprint Backlog**: Tasks and their assignments
- **Definition of Done**: Completion criteria
- **Sprint Review**: What was accomplished
- **Sprint Retrospective**: What went well, what could be improved
